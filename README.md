# Optimizing Website Performance and User Experience
# Step 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning
## Load and explore each dataset (user_interactions.csv, purchase_data.csv, website_performance.csv) to identify missing values, outliers, or any data quality issues.

# Step 2: Cohort Analysis for User Retention
## Perform a cohort analysis based on user sign-up dates to understand user retention and behavior over time. Follow these steps:

## a. Create a new table that contains unique user IDs and their sign-up dates. This will be your cohort table.

## b. Calculate the "Month since Sign-up" for each user to determine the number of months since they signed up.

## c. Group users by their sign-up cohorts and calculate the count of users in each cohort for each "Month since Sign-up."

## d. Visualize the cohort analysis using a heatmap or a line chart to understand user retention over time for different sign-up cohorts.

# Step 3: Determine Lifetime Value (LTV) of Customers
## Calculate the lifetime value (LTV) of customers acquired during different time periods. Follow these steps:

## a. Join the "purchase_data.csv" with the cohort table (containing user sign-up dates) based on the user IDs.

## b. Calculate the total transaction amount for each customer.

## c. Group customers by their sign-up cohorts and calculate the average LTV for each cohort.

## d. Visualize the LTV data using a bar chart or any suitable visualization to compare LTV across different sign-up cohorts.

# Step 4: Website Performance Optimization
## Analyze website performance metrics (page load time, bounce rate, conversion rate) to identify areas for improvement. Follow these steps:

## a. Explore and visualize the website_performance.csv data to understand trends and patterns in page load time, bounce rate, and conversion rate.

## b. Identify time periods with low conversion rates or high bounce rates to target for improvement.

## c. Analyze the relationship between page load time and conversion rate to see if there's any correlation.

# Step 5: Propose Strategies to Improve Website Performance
## Based on the analysis, propose strategies to reduce bounce rate and improve the conversion rate. Some strategies could include:

# Optimize website loading speed to reduce bounce rates.
## Improve the user interface and navigation to enhance user experience and encourage conversions.
## Implement targeted marketing campaigns to re-engage users and improve retention.
## Conduct A/B testing for different website elements to identify the most effective design and content.
